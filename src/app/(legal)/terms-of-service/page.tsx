              Exoria provides a creative playground where you can design, chat
              with, and share AI-powered characters (&ldquo;AI
              Characters&rdquo;), generate images and videos (&ldquo;Generated
              Media&rdquo;), collaborate with others on visual boards
              (&ldquo;Boards&rdquo;), and interact in shared spaces
              (&ldquo;Groups&rdquo;). The Services utilize advanced third-party
              generative artificial intelligence models to bring your ideas to
              life.

              unpredictable and may sometimes be inaccurate, incomplete, or
              offensive.
