      â€¢ Replace `Logo.tsx`, `AppScreen.tsx` logo, and `favicon.ico` with Exoria assets.  
      â€¢ Add `apple-touch-icon.png`.

## 6. Deployment & Performance
- [ ] Verify Vercel build passes after asset & route changes.
- [ ] Add 308 redirect `/download` â†’ TestFlight/App Store URL.

## 7. Waitlist & Clerk Integration ðŸ“¥
Early-access capacity will be controlled with Clerk's **Waitlist** mode and a simple sign-in once users are approved.

1. **Dependencies & Env**
   - [ ] `npm install @clerk/nextjs`
   - [ ] Add to `.env`  
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=â€¦
     CLERK_SECRET_KEY=â€¦
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
     ```
2. **Provider & Middleware**
   - [ ] Wrap root layout with  
     ```tsx
     <ClerkProvider waitlistUrl="/" >
       â€¦childrenâ€¦
     </ClerkProvider>
     ```
   - [ ] Create `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` (see guide matcher block).
3. **Waitlist Component**
   - [ ] Add `Waitlist` page (likely `/` until launch, or dedicated `/waitlist`).
   - [ ] After launch, keep the Waitlist component visible for overflow users.
4. **Sign-In Flow**
   - [ ] Add `<SignIn />` page at `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`.
   - [ ] Update buttons/links (header/footer/CTA) to route to `/sign-in` post-approval.
5. **Dashboard Configuration**
   - [ ] Enable **Waitlist** mode in Clerk Dashboard â†’ Restrictions.
   - [ ] Process invites manually via Dashboard until capacity increases.

> Note: All marketing pages remain public; only authenticated (app) routes will sit behind Clerk once the web dashboard is needed.

## 8. Post-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Submit site to App Store Connect for domain association (`apple-app-site-association` if deep links required).
- [ ] Verify legal pages pass Apple & Google review guidelines.
- [ ] Share TestFlight link in hero & CTA; swap to App Store link on public release.
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring.
