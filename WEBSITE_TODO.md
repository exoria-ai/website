      â€¢ Replace `Logo.tsx`, `AppScreen.tsx` logo, and `favicon.ico` with Exoria assets.  
      â€¢ Add `apple-touch-icon.png`.
- [ ] **README:** Overwrite `website/README.md` with tech-focused setup notes for contributors.
- [ ] **Clean CHANGELOG:** Start a fresh changelog for the website (preserve old file in git history).

## 2. Content & Component Updates

- **Secondary Features (`SecondaryFeatures.tsx`)**
  - [ ] Six quick-hit perks sourced from `FEATURES.md` (Voice & Audio, Smart Conversations, Media Gallery, etc.).
  - [ ] Update icons if necessary.

- **Call to Action (`CallToAction.tsx`)**
  - [ ] Rewrite copy to push TestFlight download.
  - [ ] Make sure AppStore/TestFlight badge uses correct URL and alt text.

- **Reviews (`Reviews.tsx`)**
  - [ ] Insert real or marketing-grade testimonials about Exoria (placeholder OK until collected).

- **Pricing (`Pricing.tsx`)**
  - [ ] Reflect Exoria's tiers (Free with 100 credits, Pro, Pro + Voice, etc.).
  - [ ] Sync plan descriptions & feature lists with current product offering.

- **FAQs (`Faqs.tsx`)**
  - [ ] Replace satire with genuine support FAQs (privacy, credits, model tiers, voice features).

## 3. New Pages & Legal
| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/privacy` | Privacy Policy (App Store compliant) |
| `/tos`     | Terms of Service / EULA |
| `/support` | Simple contact page with mailto: or Help Center link |

> Add static MDX or simple React pages under `src/app/(legal)/`.

---

## 4. Technical SEO & Analytics
- [ ] Configure **meta tags** & Open Graph (title, description, image, twitter card).
- [ ] Add `sitemap.xml` & `robots.txt` (Next-sitemap or manual generator).
- [ ] Set `next.config.js` â†’ `images.domains` if remote screenshots used.
- [ ] Integrate Plausible / GA4 tracking (respect GDPR consent).
- [ ] Lighthouse pass: ensure a11y colour contrast and alt text.

---

## 5. Code Cleanup & Dependencies
- [ ] Delete unused auth pages and routes (`src/app/(auth)`).
- [ ] Remove `StockLogos.tsx`, demo finance components, unused images.
- [ ] Replace `LICENSE.md` with Exoria licence or reference ToS.
- [ ] Audit `package.json` and trim dev dependencies no longer required.
- [ ] Run `npm run check` after every major change (linter, knip dead-code check).

---

## 6. Deployment & Performance
- [ ] Verify Vercel build passes after asset & route changes.
- [ ] Add 308 redirect `/download` â†’ TestFlight/App Store URL.
- [ ] Enable image optimisation (`next/image` placeholder blur).
- [ ] Lazy-load heavy components (screenshots, video demo).
- [ ] Configure caching headers via `next.config.js` for static assets.

---

## 7. Waitlist & Clerk Integration ðŸ“¥
Early-access capacity will be controlled with Clerk's **Waitlist** mode and a simple sign-in once users are approved.

1. **Dependencies & Env**
   - [ ] `npm install @clerk/nextjs`
   - [ ] Add to `.env`  
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=â€¦
     CLERK_SECRET_KEY=â€¦
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
     ```
2. **Provider & Middleware**
   - [ ] Wrap root layout with  
     ```tsx
     <ClerkProvider waitlistUrl="/" >
       â€¦childrenâ€¦
     </ClerkProvider>
     ```
   - [ ] Create `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` (see guide matcher block).
3. **Waitlist Component**
   - [ ] Add `Waitlist` page (likely `/` until launch, or dedicated `/waitlist`).
   - [ ] After launch, keep the Waitlist component visible for overflow users.
4. **Sign-In Flow**
   - [ ] Add `<SignIn />` page at `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`.
   - [ ] Update buttons/links (header/footer/CTA) to route to `/sign-in` post-approval.
5. **Dashboard Configuration**
   - [ ] Enable **Waitlist** mode in Clerk Dashboard â†’ Restrictions.
   - [ ] Process invites manually via Dashboard until capacity increases.

> Note: All marketing pages remain public; only authenticated (app) routes will sit behind Clerk once the web dashboard is needed.

---

## 8. Post-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Submit site to App Store Connect for domain association (`apple-app-site-association` if deep links required).
- [ ] Verify legal pages pass Apple & Google review guidelines.
- [ ] Share TestFlight link in hero & CTA; swap to App Store link on public release.
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring.
